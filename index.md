 I am a Postdoc affiliated with the [Chair for Regional Climate and Hydrology at the University of Augsburg](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/de/fakultaet/fai/geo/prof/georkl/uber-uns/c-chwala/) and currently working as a guest [researcher at the KIT Campus Alpin](https://www.imk-ifu.kit.edu/staff_Christian_Chwala.php) in the [group of Prof. Harald Kunstmann](Regional Climate and Hydrology).

 I did my PhD at KIT Campus Alpin in cooperation with the [Chair of High-Frequency Engineering at TU Munich](https://www.ei.tum.de/en/hft/home/) and graduated from the University of Augsburg in 2015.

## Research profile

 My main research field is remote sensing and hydrometeorology. I focus on improving rainfall observations by using new opportunistic sensors and via the combination of rainfall sensors. I combine these efforts with performing hydrological simulations for flood events in small complex catchments and support this research with dedicated field measurements campaigns.
